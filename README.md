My first Repo

Hello!

I am new to GitHub. I want to become familiar with the site, along with learning how to contribute to coding projects.

The languages I know are:
  -Java
  -Python
  -C++
  -a little bit of web scripts (html, css)
  
I still in university, and I am looking to be involved in cool projects, as well as experience!
